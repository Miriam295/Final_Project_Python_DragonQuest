# Final_Project_Python_DragonQuest

For my final project, I decided to create a text-based adventure game. 
In the game, a player (the young knight) sets off on a journey to fight the white dragon, 
and has to make decisions that will ultimately influence whether they have the money and skills to defeat the dragon. 

Decisions in the game are made by entering "1" or "2" when having to make a choice. 
To start the game, one has to run the code in "The Dragon Quest" file 
and will then interact with the game via the choices presented.
Testing the code happens while playing, no additional testing is required.
The file "Dragon Support" contains all the functions and classes that make the game run. 

The required packages can be found in the provided "requirements.txt" package.
